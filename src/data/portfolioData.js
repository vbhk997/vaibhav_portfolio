    description1: "I‚Äôm a computer science student at Penn State with a strong foundation in software development, AI/ML, and quantitative analysis. Alongside my degree, I‚Äôm pursuing minors in Engineering Entrepreneurship and Cybersecurity, and I‚Äôve made the Dean‚Äôs List every semester with a GPA of 3.83. My academic path has been driven by curiosity and a hands-on approach, whether it‚Äôs building machine learning pipelines, designing embedded systems, or creating full-stack applications, I enjoy bridging theory with real-world problem solving.",
    description2: "Professionally, I‚Äôve worked as a Machine Learning & Data Analytics Intern at Indian Oil Corporation, where I applied clustering and churn prediction models on large customer datasets to support retention strategies and safeguard recurring sales. As a Software Developer Intern at A.I.L.S, I built scalable form-builder and workflow automation systems, integrating APIs, microservices, and secure authentication in production-ready environments. These roles gave me experience across both applied data science and robust software engineering.",
    description3: "Beyond academics and internships, I co-founded the Hyperloop Development Club at Penn State, where I lead technical strategy for a 40+ member interdisciplinary team, and serve as Secretary for the Association for Computing Machinery, helping organize technical workshops and events for thousands of students. My projects span from financial analytics systems and legal AI assistants to an AI-powered smart notes app for STEM learners. Whether developing ML strategies with measurable impact or building tools that improve everyday productivity, I thrive at the intersection of technology, data, and innovation.",

By bringing these two data sources together, the system can identify early signs of stress and anxiety with higher reliability. To improve accuracy over time, the pipeline integrates baseline calibration, drift detection, and Hidden Markov smoothing to handle signal variability and user-specific differences.",
